Financial Indicator Formulas

1. Simple Moving Average (SMA)

The SMA is the average stock price over a specific period. The formula is straightforward:

SMA = (Sum of Closing Prices over N periods) / N

2. Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

EMA gives more weight to recent prices and reacts more quickly to price changes than the SMA. The formula for EMA is:

EMA_today = (Value_today × (Smoothing / (1 + N))) + EMA_yesterday × (1 - (Smoothing / (1 + N)))

Where N is the number of periods, and Smoothing is typically set to 2.

3. Relative Strength Index (RSI)

RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements, oscillating between zero and 100. The formula is:

RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))

Where RS (Relative Strength) = Average Gain / Average Loss over N periods.

4. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator showing the relationship between two EMAs of a security’s price:

MACD = EMA_fast - EMA_slow

Typically, EMA_fast is 12 periods, and EMA_slow is 26 periods. A signal line, the EMA of MACD, is also plotted.

5. Bollinger Bands

Bollinger Bands consist of a middle band (SMA) and two outer bands that are standard deviations away from the SMA:

Middle Band = SMA_N-period

Upper Band = SMA_N-period + (Standard Deviation of Price × 2)

Lower Band = SMA_N-period - (Standard Deviation of Price × 2)

Where N is typically 20 periods.
