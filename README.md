## Data Science Using R Language

Hello everyone! While I primarily focus on Python programming, today we're going to apply our data science expertise to tackle similar problems using R Programming. We'll embark on a journey through various models including linear regression, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and clustering models. This will be an exciting opportunity to explore how R can be leveraged for robust data analysis and model building in the realm of data science.
