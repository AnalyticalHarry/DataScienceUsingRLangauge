## Data Science Using R Language

Hello everyone! While I code in Python programming, today we're going to apply our data science expertise to tackle similar problems using R Programming. our journey will be through various models including linear regression, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and clustering models. This will be an exciting opportunity to explore how R can be expertise for our data analysis and model building in the data science.
